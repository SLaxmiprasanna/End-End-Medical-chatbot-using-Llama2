# End-to-End Medical Chatbot using Llama2

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **End-to-End Medical Chatbot** using **Llama2**, a powerful language model, designed to answer medical-related queries, assist patients, and provide general medical advice based on pre-trained models. The chatbot integrates with various tools and techniques to ensure accurate, reliable, and contextually aware responses.

## Features

- **Llama2 Integration**: Utilizes the Llama2 language model for natural language understanding and response generation.
- **Medical Knowledge**: Designed to handle medical-related questions with a focus on providing accurate and informative answers.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Covers the entire process from data preparation, model training, evaluation, to deployment.
- **Interactive Chatbot Interface**: Allows users to interact with the chatbot through an easy-to-use interface.
- **Customizable**: The model can be fine-tuned with additional datasets to improve its performance on specific medical topics.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/entbappy/End-to-end-Medical-Chatbot-using-Llama2.git
   cd End-to-end-Medical-Chatbot-using-Llama2
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Llama2 model**:
   You need to download the Llama2 model from the official [Llama2 page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama), and place it in the appropriate directory as specified in the project.

5. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: The project comes with a set of medical-related datasets for training. You can also integrate your own data for a more personalized chatbot experience.
   
2. **Model Training**: Llama2 is fine-tuned on medical-related queries to provide accurate responses. The chatbot uses this model to generate real-time answers based on user inputs.

3. **Deployment**: The project is designed for easy deployment, either locally or on cloud platforms, to serve as a conversational AI tool for medical assistance.

4. **Interactive Interface**: The chatbot can be accessed through a web-based or CLI interface, allowing users to interact and ask medical-related questions.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start asking medical-related questions. The chatbot will generate responses using the Llama2 model and provide informative, context-aware answers.

Hereâ€™s an example of interacting with the chatbot:

```bash
> How should I treat a cold?
The best way to treat a cold is to get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and use over-the-counter medications to ease symptoms like a sore throat or headache.
```

## Future Improvements

- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the Llama2 model with more domain-specific medical data for enhanced accuracy.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand the chatbot to support multiple languages for non-English-speaking users.
- **Voice Integration**: Add a voice-based interface for users who prefer interacting via speech.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure the chatbot meets medical regulatory standards for providing advice.
